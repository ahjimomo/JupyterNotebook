## Project Introduction: Web Scraping - Basic
Our target is to source for a static website to pull out information around the role of a Business Analyst in Australia from https://www.monster.com/jobs/search/

The script would pull out the results from the website & return all the specific job postings for the user to vet through easily and access for job application.

### Platform
We are using Python 3.7.3 on Jupyter Notebook to implement this script

### Information
This script is prepared by Nicky Ng [@ahjimomo](https://github.com/ahjimomo) as of 13 May 2020
